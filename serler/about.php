	<h2>About SERL</h2>
	<p>

	<p>
	 The Software Engineering Research Lab (SERL) at AUT University undertakes world-class research directed
	  at understanding and improving the practice of software professionals in their creation and preservation 
	  of software systems. We are interested in all models of software provision â€“ bespoke development, package
	   and component customisation, free/libre open source software (FLOSS) development, and delivery of software
	    as a service (SaaS). The research we carry out may relate to just one or all of these models.
	</p>
	
	<h2>About SERLER</h2>
	<p>
		SERL wishes to host a repository for capturing evidence relating to software development methods and will populate the repository with evidence relating to a selection of methods. Access to the repository will be via web service interface. 

The larger aim for creating such a repository is to build a body of evidence that will support researchers and practitioners in decision-making during software projects. 
The repository system, i.e. data store plus access mechanisms, will be named SERLER. 

The application to be developed is a structured repository of data on empirical studies of software engineering practices.
